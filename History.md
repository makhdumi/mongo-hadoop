1.5.1 / 9th of March, 2016
==========================

This release features a few fixes from 1.5.0, including patching a few MongoDB
connection leaks, avoiding a warning when using MongoUpdateStorage with Pig, and
allowing a limit to be set on MongoInputSplits.

For complete details on the issues resolved in 1.5.1, consult the release notes
on Jira: https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/HADOOP/fixforversion/16544

1.5.0 / 23rd of February, 2016
==============================

This release features major improvements to Pig, Hive, and Spark. Pig and Hive
both have the ability to push down simple queries and projections to MongoDB,
potentially saving time and memory when running MapReduce jobs. New included
UDFs allow writing MongoDB-specific types from Pig jobs and extracting timestamp
information from ObjectIds. A new "pymongo-spark" library (under
spark/src/main/python) allows using PyMongo objects with the connector, greatly
simplifying the Python interface to Spark when running with MongoDB.

For a complete list of tickets resolved in this release, see the release notes
on Jira: https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/HADOOP/fixforversion/15466

Changes from rc0:

   * [HADOOP-255] Return null early in getTypeForBSON if input is null.

1.0.0 / 2012-04-09 
==================

  * Fixed file distribution for streaming addon files
  * Fixed Thrift dep for cdh3.
  * Add treasury yield example build support.
  * Added a Streaming Example M/R job with enron email corpus
  * HADOOP-29 - removes excessive logging for each tuple stored in MongoDB (RJurney)
  * Streaming: Add support for python generators in reduce functions (MLew)
  * Pig: Fix for exporting tuples to mongodb as map
  * Fixed CDH4 build flags to correct compilation step.
  * Fixed Hadoop build for dependencies across versions.
  * Added a "load-sample-data" task to use for loading samples into mongo for testing/demos
  * Hadoop 0.22.x support now works for those who need it (although I believe it's a deprecated branch)
  * Stock Apache 0.23.x now builds, using the actual 0.23.1 release...  insanity around the MapReduce dep
  * added twitter hashtag examples
  * Relocate Pymongo_Hadoop module to a new "language_Support" subdirectory. Created a setup.py file to build an egg / package. Available on PyPi as 'pymongo_hadoop'.
  * Fixed pymongo_hadoop output to use BSON.encode
  * Added support to streaming for the -file flag to distribute files out to the cluster if they don't exist.
  * Make InputFormat and OutputFormat implied on Streaming jobs, defaulting to the Mongo ones.
  * Streaming now builds as a fat assembly jar and works.
  * Added an 0.23 / cdh4 build.  No longer allow raw "cdh" or "cloudera" build artifacts to avoid confusion as to 'which cloudera?'
  * Added a .23 build, based on Cloudera's current distro (should be binary compatible with stock)
  * If combiner is not specified, do not pass it to Hadoop.  While the combiner should be optional, giving Hadoop a null combiner will result in a NullPointerException.

1.0.0-rc0 / 2012-02-12 
==================

  * Initial Release, Release Candidate
